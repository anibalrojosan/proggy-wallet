2.  **Details**: Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and the potential impact.
3.  **Response**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.
4.  **Disclosure**: We will coordinate the fix and a public disclosure date with you.

Thank you for helping keep Proggy Wallet secure!
