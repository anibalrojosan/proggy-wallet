> This project is under active development. Currently it's in **Phase 2: Robustness & Architecture**, where I'm refactoring the previous codebase to implement a **Repository Pattern** and migrate to **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database management system.

**Proggy Wallet** is a comprehensive engineering roadmap designed to architect a production-ready **Full-Stack Fintech solution**. This project documents the complete lifecycle of modern software development, bridging the gap between a dynamic **Frontend prototype** and a scalable **Django ecosystem**.

It serves as a definitive technical reference for industry best practices, implementing a **Monolithic Architecture** through Django’s **MTV (Model-Template-View)** pattern. By consolidating logic and presentation, the project integrates advanced **Python logic**, **SQL persistence**, and automated **DevOps workflows** (Docker & CI/CD) to demonstrate the rigorous evolution from initial code to global cloud deployment.

## Key Features

Proggy Wallet combines a modern user experience with a robust backend engine. The system is designed to handle the core requirements of a digital wallet while maintaining high standards of data integrity and security:

*   🚀 **FastAPI REST API**: High-performance asynchronous backend with automatic documentation.
*   🔐 **Secure Auth**: Industry-standard password hashing with `bcrypt` to protect user identities.
*   💰 **Atomic Transactions**: Financial integrity ensured through manual rollback logic for transfers.
*   ✅ **Strict Validation**: Fail-fast data integrity using `Pydantic` models for all incoming requests.
*   📱 **Responsive UI**: A mobile-first web interface built with Bootstrap 5 and jQuery.

## Project Evolution

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's evolution, from the initial prototype to the current state:

- 📝 **[DEVLOG](docs/DEVLOG.md)**: Daily technical logs, hurdles, and solutions.
- 🗺️ **[ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md)**: Our path from prototype to production.
- 🏗️ **[ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Deep dive into our system design and ADRs.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
This project uses [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for blazing-fast Python package and project management. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Installation & Setup
Clone the repository and sync the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/proggy-wallet.git
cd proggy-wallet
uv sync
```

### 3. Execution
*   **API Server (FastAPI):** Start the backend for frontend communication:
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
    ```
*   **Frontend:** Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (Recommended: Use VS Code 'Live Server').
*   **CLI Simulation:** Run a full end-to-end logic test:
    ```bash
    uv run python -m backend.main
    ```

## Quality Control & Testing
This project follows strict PEP 8 standards and is fully tested.
- **Linting**: `uv run ruff check`
- **Tests**: `uv run pytest`

## Architecture & Security (Phase 2)

Proggy Wallet is built with a focus on **maintainability** and **financial integrity**. It's currently transitioning to a professional enterprise architecture:

*   **🏛️ Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between API, Service Layer (`TransactionManager`), and Domain Entities to ensure the system is easy to scale and test.
*   **💎 Software Atomicity**: Financial transactions follow the "all-or-nothing" principle. Manual rollback mechanisms are implemented to prevent data corruption during failures.
*   **🛡️ Industry-Standard Security**: User protection is paramount. `bcrypt` is used for secure, non-reversible password hashing and Pydantic for strict schema enforcement.
*   **📦 Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access to allow a seamless migration from flat files to **PostgreSQL** without touching the core business logic.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** `HTML5`, `CSS/Bootstrap 5`, `JavaScript/jQuery`.
* **Backend:** `Python 3.12+`, `FastAPI`, `Pydantic V2`.
* **Security:** `Bcrypt` password hashing.
* **Tooling:** `uv` (Package Manager), `Ruff` (Linter/Formatter), `Pytest`.
* **Infrastructure:** `Docker` (Coming soon), `GitHub Actions`.
