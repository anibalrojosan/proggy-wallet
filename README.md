# Proggy Wallet 🪙

> This project it's currently under development. Done with ❤️ by Aníbal Rojo.

**Proggy Wallet** is a comprehensive engineering roadmap designed to architect a production-ready **Full-Stack Fintech solution**. This project documents the complete lifecycle of modern software development, bridging the gap between a dynamic **Frontend prototype** and a scalable **Django ecosystem**.

It serves as a definitive technical reference for industry best practices, integrating advanced **Python logic**, **SQL persistence**, and automated **DevOps workflows** (Docker & CI/CD) to demonstrate the rigorous evolution from initial code to global cloud deployment.

### Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** `HTML5`, `CSS/Bootstrap 5`, `JavaScript/jQuery`.
* **Backend:** `Python`, `Django`.
* **Modern Tooling:** `uv` (Manager), `Ruff` (Linter), `Pydantic` (Validation).
* **Infrastructure:** `Docker`, `GitHub Actions`.

Currently in **Phase 1 (Foundations)**, focusing on clean architecture, strict code quality standards, and secure data handling logic.
